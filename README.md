# twelveDrawings

Twelve Drawings was completed as I worked through Treehouse's front-end development track. I chose a site for a family member who is very involved in the Twelve Step recovery program. 

The Twelve Drawings gallery calls attention the original Twelve Steps by listing verbatim definitions of key words using a Webster’s dictionary from that time period and through new illustrations which show how one individual applies these “old school” Twelve Step words to his daily recovery.

My final project for front-end development is posted below via GitHub. I created it using HTML, JavaScript/JQuery, CSS/Sass, and a few choice plug-ins (including the Slick responsive carousel).
